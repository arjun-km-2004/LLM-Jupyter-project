    "Financial professionals, investors, and credit officers must sift through lengthy balance sheets, management discussions, and statistical appendices before they can form a view on a company's fundamentals. The manual process is slow, error-prone, and often leads to missed red flags or opportunities. This notebook demonstrates how AI-assisted reasoning over text prompts and image scans of financial statements can compress the time needed to extract actionable insights."

    "This project showcases how a conversation-style text prompt (\"chat prompt\") can be paired with image understanding to read financial statements. Chat prompts tell the AI model which metrics investors care about, while image prompts focus on extracting structured values from scanned pages, tables, and charts. By orchestrating both inputs, the analyst receives explanations, trend narratives, and investor-ready commentary without manually parsing every page."
